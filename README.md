Predicting Credit Card Fraud Using a KNN Model

This project aims to create a KNN model to predict credit card fraud using a credit card fraud prediction dataset uploaded on Kaggle. The dataset is composed of features describing the transaction and characterizing the cardholder/merchant. With 555,719 instances and 22 attributes, a mix of categorical and numerical data types, the dataset provides a considerable amount of features to choose from for a strong foundation for the model.

Reported results: ~93.8% accuracy and ~88.6% precision for the final model
